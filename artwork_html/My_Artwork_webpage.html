            <img src="images/burn_pigeon.HEIC" alt="Burnt Pigeon">
            <p>I got to a point after trying to sketch more vultures and failing i tried to draw a bird looking straight, but once i finished i was like hey this looks like a pigeon so i put burn marks on it an was okay with the results</p>
