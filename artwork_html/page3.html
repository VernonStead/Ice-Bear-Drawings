          <p>Sooo this idea started when my girlfriend would draw me hearts with wings on them, than she started drawing a halo on them. i started drawing them back adding more detail into them, and because for some reason I like to draw horns i just started adding horns to them. Than i wanted to photo shop it so I did.</p>
