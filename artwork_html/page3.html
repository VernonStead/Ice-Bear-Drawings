                <img src="images/chief-keef-hotdog.PNG" alt="Chief keef hotdog">
                <p>Chief Keef Hot dog, I think this is extremely funny like how is it not, I looked at one of his album covers and was like, lets make him a hot dog, cause that "stuff" is hilarious. I also got bored and really just did what ever with the background. I really have been enjoying making like  a floating island and having chains conneceted to it. I also gave him like a super gun because i also thought that was random and hilarious.</p>

Than i wanted to photo shop it so I did.</p>
